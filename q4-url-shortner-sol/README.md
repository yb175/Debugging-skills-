# Q3: URL shortener service

## What you should know

Before you begin, make sure you understand:

- HTTP APIs and status codes
- Express routing and middleware
- SQL / SQLite CRUD operations
- URL validation
- Concurrency and database atomicity

---

## Scenario

Build the backend for a URL shortening service. The project includes Express route stubs and a SQLite helper. Complete the routes in `app.js` and write the service logic in `shortener.js`.

## What to build

The service must support:

- creating short links
- redirecting short links
- querying link metadata
- deleting short links
- querying aggregate statistics

The response bodies and status codes below are part of the contract, so match them exactly.

## Implementation

- Complete the Express routes in `app.js`.
- Implement `URLShortener` and `Link` in `shortener.js`.

## API

### Create a short link

`POST /links`

Request body:

```json
{
  "long_url": "https://example.com/a/very/long/page",
  "custom_code": "docs_2026",
  "ttl_seconds": 3600
}
```

- `long_url` is required and must:
  - be a string
  - use `http://` or `https://`
  - include a valid host
- `custom_code` is optional. When provided, it must match: `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{3,32}$`
- `ttl_seconds` is optional. When provided, it must be a positive non-boolean number.

Processing rules:

- A duplicate custom code must return `409 Conflict`.
- Automatically generated codes must match: `^[A-Za-z0-9]{6,10}$`
- If an auto-generated code collides with an existing short code in the database, retry up to five times. If all attempts fail, return `500`.
- The same long URL may be shortened more than once. Each request creates a separate short link.
- When `ttl_seconds` is provided, the expiration time is `expires_at = created_at + ttl_seconds`.

> A link is expired when: `expires_at IS NOT NULL AND current_time >= expires_at`

Success response: `201 Created`

```json
{
  "short_code": "docs_2026",
  "short_url": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs_2026",
  "long_url": "https://example.com/a/very/long/page",
  "created_at": 1760000000.0,
  "expires_at": 1760003600.0,
  "hit_count": 0,
  "is_expired": false,
  "owner_token": "tok_secret"
}
```

### Redirect

`GET /<short_code>`

Return `410 Gone` for an expired link without changing `hit_count`. For an active link, add 1 to `hit_count` and return `302 Found` with the original URL in the `Location` header.

### Get link metadata

`GET /links/<short_code>`

Success response: `200 OK`

```json
{
  "short_code": "docs_2026",
  "long_url": "https://example.com/a/very/long/page",
  "created_at": 1760000000.0,
  "expires_at": 1760003600.0,
  "hit_count": 12,
  "is_expired": false
}
```

> The metadata response must not include `owner_token`.

### Delete a short link

`DELETE /links/<short_code>`

Request body:

```json
{
  "owner_token": "tok_secret"
}
```

| Case | Status code |
|------|-------------|
| Missing `owner_token` | `400 Bad Request` |
| Wrong `owner_token` | `403 Forbidden` |
| Short code not found | `404 Not Found` |

Deletion removes the link completely from the public behavior of the service. It can no longer be fetched or redirected, and it no longer contributes to stats.

Success response: `200 OK`

```json
{
  "deleted": "docs_2026"
}
```

### Stats

`GET /stats`

Success response: `200 OK`

- `total_links`: count of all non-deleted links
- `total_hits`: sum of hit counts across all non-deleted links
- `top_5_links` sort order: `hit_count` descending, then `short_code` ascending for ties

> Expired but non-deleted links are included in stats.

```json
{
  "total_links": 10,
  "total_hits": 384,
  "top_5_links": [
    {
      "short_code": "abc123",
      "long_url": "https://example.com",
      "hit_count": 120
    }
  ]
}
```

## Notes

- Return every API error as JSON, including malformed request bodies and unsupported methods. The object must have exactly this shape:
  ```json
  {
    "error": "description"
  }
  ```

## Estimated completion time

60 minutes

## Files

The starter project contains:

- `app.js`: Express route skeleton (complete the implementation)
- `shortener.js`: service layer (complete the implementation)
- `db.js`: completed SQLite connection helper, provided for reference
- `test_client.js`: public end-to-end smoke test
- `test_shortener.js`: public unit tests for the service layer
- `README.md`: this file
- `package.json`: project configuration and dependencies

Only edit `app.js` and `shortener.js`.

## Running locally

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the unit tests:

```bash
npm test
```
or
```bash
node test_shortener.js
```

Run the public end-to-end smoke test:

```bash
npm run smoke
```
or
```bash
node test_client.js
```

To try the API manually, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Then send requests to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/links \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"long_url":"https://example.com","custom_code":"demo"}'
```
